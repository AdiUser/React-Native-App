# Things that are used - A Rough Idea

This app is built with an awesome JavaScript framework called React-Native. 
With React Native, you don't build a "mobile web app", an "HTML5 app", or a "hybrid app". You build a real mobile app that's indistinguishable from an app built using Objective-C or Java. React Native uses the same fundamental UI building blocks as regular iOS and Android apps. You just put those building blocks together using JavaScript and React.

### About the app

The application simply fetches data that is stored on a hosted server through MDN's Fetch API.
The fetched data is in (quite obvious) JSON format which is then ultimately manipulated for displaying in the application.
